# 🧠 Task 8: Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score from the **Mall Customers dataset**. It includes preprocessing, finding the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, PCA-based visualization, and evaluation using Silhouette Score.

## 📁 Files

- `Mall_Customers.csv` — Dataset used for clustering
- `task8_kmeans_clustering.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with full code and analysis
- `requirements.txt` — List of required Python packages
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📌 Task Objectives

- Load and visualize dataset (with optional PCA for 2D plotting)
- Apply K-Means clustering
- Use Elbow Method to determine optimal K
- Visualize clusters with PCA
- Evaluate clustering with Silhouette Score
